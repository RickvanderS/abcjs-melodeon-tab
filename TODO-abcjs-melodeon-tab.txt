Bugs:
- During typing [ab]- some error about rest not found
- Melodeon: Multiple notes between [] does not properly determine push/pull dir (special handling required for bar and count)
- Melodeon: Begin of tune with "" seems to have different behaviour than no chord at all
- "Show all (remaining) possibilities" should not show ties
- Transpose ABC gives problems with clarinet cleff
Improvements:
- Minimize the number of changes in non-melodeon source files (TabRenderer.prototype.doScan)
- Support 4th row (one harmonica bend is currently missing)
New features:
- Optional push/pull indicators for notes (color? or next to chords)
- Row label style: cicle around
- Option to disable chord thirds (so chord is neither minor or major)
- Custom layout inputs
- Export ABC with injected tablature
