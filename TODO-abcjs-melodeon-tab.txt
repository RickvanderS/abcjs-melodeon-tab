Bugs:
- Melodeon: Multiple notes between [] does not properly determine push/pull dir (special handling required for bar and count)
- Melodeon: Begin of tune with "" seems to have different behaviour than no chord at all
Improvements:
- Use , instead of ; to indicate row 3
- Minimize the number of changes in non-melodeon source files (TabRenderer.prototype.doScan)
- Harmonica: Syncronize with changes in Melodeon
New features:
- Hide tablature (useful when we only want note heads and/or push pull indicators)
- Other types/styles of tablature
- Optional push/pull indicators next to chords
- Export ABC with injected tablature
- Option to disable chord thirds (so chord is neither minor or major)
abcjs:
- Key change end of bar
