Bugs:
- Melodeon: Multiple notes between [] does not properly determine push/pull dir (special handling required for bar and count)
- Melodeon: Begin of tune with "" seems to have different behaviour than no chord at all
- Melodeon: Do show button numbers on tie when at least one note changed
- Melodeon: Algorithms quits on tie ends, should check tie is same note and should continue in order to do note head change (same note head as tie start)
Improvements:
- Minimize the number of changes in non-melodeon source files (TabRenderer.prototype.doScan)
- Harmonica: Syncronize with changes in Melodeon
New features:
- 2.5 and 3 row melodeons
- Hide tablature (useful when we only want note heads and/or push pull indicators)
- Optional push/pull indicators next to chords
abcjs:
- Key change end of bar
