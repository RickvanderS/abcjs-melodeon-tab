Bugs:
- Melodeon: Multiple notes between [] does not properly determine push/pull dir (special handling required for bar and count)
- Melodeon: Begin of tune with "" seems to have different behaviour than no chord at all
Improvements:
- Minimize the number of changes in non-melodeon source files (TabRenderer.prototype.doScan)
- Harmonica: Merge harmonica into melodeon and call it diatonic tab
New features:
- Single line tablature (like harmonica)
- Line per instrument row tablature
- Optional push/pull indicators next to chords
- Export ABC with injected tablature
- Option to disable chord thirds (so chord is neither minor or major)
abcjs:
- Key change end of bar
