Bugs:
- Melodeon: Multiple notes between [] does not properly determine push/pull dir (special handling required for but bar and count)
- Melodeon: Begin of tune with "" seems to have different behaviour than no chord at all
- Melodeon: Do show button numbers on tie when at least one note changed
Improvements:
- Minimize the number of changes in non-melodeon source files
- Harmonica: Syncronize with changes in Melodeon
New features:
- 2.5 and 3 row melodeons
- Hide tableture, but do show rows by changing note heads (take inspiration from %percmap)
abcjs:
- Key change end of bar
- Print page breaks
